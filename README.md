# Path Planning with Metaheuristic Algorithms

![](Path%20Planning.png "Path Planning"){ width="295" height="295" style="display: block; margin: 0 auto" }

This repository provides implementations of path planning using metaheuristic algorithms, 
including IPSO, IGWO, and ABC. It includes an example file `Planner.cpp` in the `source` directory.

## Usages

### Helper Python Scripts

This repository also includes three helper Python scripts in the `scripts` directory:

- `create_costmap_from_image.py`: This Python script converts an image file representing 
a map into a text-based cost map file. The cost map file contains information about the obstacles 
and traversable areas in the map. Darker areas in the image represent lethal or high-cost regions.
The cost values range from 0 to 255, where 0 represents free areas and higher values signify avoidance areas.
- `create_image_from_costmap.py`: This Python script performs the inverse operation of `create_costmap_from_image.py`. 
It takes a text-based cost map file and converts it into an image representation.
- `plot_waypoint.py`: This Python script plots the waypoints generated by a path planning algorithm from `Planner.cpp`.
The script provide options for customizing the appearance of the plotted waypoints, 
such as colors, markers, and labels.

### Adjusting Lethal Area Cost

You can adjust the minimum cost for defining lethal areas by modifying the macro `LETHAL_COST` in the `Utility.h` file.
